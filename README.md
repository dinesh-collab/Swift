The basic idea is to take a picture in real time using your handheld device and then breakit into  pieces to create a puzzle game. 

After breaking picture into 8 pieces, pieces are jumbled and placed in a 3X3 grid that user move with fingers one step for each time. Goal is to arrange the pieces into original image. 

We provide different level of difficulty levels to users. Based on the difficulty level we set time laps for that game.

We provide hint for the users to show original image for 3 seconds in between the game. A scoreboard records the lowest time for each level as well. The latest lowest score is shown on home screen as well.
